  "name": "DEL",
  "summary": "Deletes one or more keys.",
  "complexity": "O(N) where N is the number of keys that will be removed. When a key to remove holds a value other than a string, the individual complexity for this key is O(M) where M is the number of elements in the list, set, sorted set or hash. Removing a single key that holds a string value is O(1)."
