  "summary": "Returns members in a sorted set within a lexicographical range.",
  "complexity": "O(log(N)+M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements being returned. If M is constant (e.g. always asking for the first 10 elements with LIMIT), you can consider it O(log(N))."
