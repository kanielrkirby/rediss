  "name": "SUBSTR",
  "summary": "Returns a substring from a string value.",
  "complexity": "O(N) where N is the length of the returned string. The complexity is ultimately determined by the returned length, but because creating a substring from an existing string is very cheap, it can be considered O(1) for small strings."
