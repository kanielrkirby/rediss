  "name": "SETRANGE",
  "summary": "Overwrites a part of a string value with another by an offset. Creates the key if it doesn't exist.",
  "complexity": "O(1), not counting the time taken to copy the new string in place. Usually, this string is very small so the amortized complexity is O(1). Otherwise, complexity is O(M) with M being the length of the value argument."
